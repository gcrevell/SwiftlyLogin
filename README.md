# SwiftlyLogin

### Snyopsis

SwiftlyLogin is a small helper class to make securing apps with accounts easier.
SwiftlyLogin provides support for verfiying emails, usernames, passwords, or any
other strings. It has built in options for requirements, allowing the developer
to define what is a legal password, then the class takes care of all the checking.

### Code Example

Coming soon!

SwiftlyLogin is still under production.

### Motivation

This project arose from my own need. I was regularly rewriting code to check logins
for users creating accounts or copying it from project to project as it was needed.
To expidate the task, I decided to move all the code into a single file.

### Installation

To install, you can download the repo and copy Login.swift into your project. Please
note that this project is still under construction and incomplete.

### Tests

All tests are in the LoginVerfierTests folder in the Xcode project.
